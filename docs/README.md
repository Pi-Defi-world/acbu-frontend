# ACBU Fintech Application

A modern, mobile-first fintech application built with Next.js 16 and React 19, featuring a comprehensive suite of financial services built exclusively around the native ACBU (AFK) currency.

## 🎯 Quick Start

The application uses a **5-tab mobile navigation** system for primary feature access:

```
┌─ Home       ─ Dashboard & overview
├─ Send       ─ P2P transfers, international, history
├─ Mint       ─ Create/redeem AFK currency
├─ Business   ─ SME, payroll, enterprise tools
└─ Me         ─ Account, settings, security
```

## 🎨 Design System

### Colors
- **Primary**: Purple/Indigo (`oklch(0.35 0.12 280)`)
- **Accent**: Teal/Cyan (`oklch(0.55 0.15 160)`)
- **Neutrals**: Grayscale (white, grays, black)
- **Currency**: AFK only (no USD, Stellar, or external references)

### Typography
- **Headings**: Use font-sans for consistency
- **Body**: Consistent 14px+ font sizes
- **Line Height**: 1.4-1.6 for readability

### Layout
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Flexbox**: Primary layout method
- **Max Width**: 28rem (md breakpoint) for content
- **Bottom Padding**: 24 (96px) for mobile nav visibility

## 💰 Currency System

The application uses **AFK (ACBU)** as the only currency:
- All balances displayed in AFK
- All transactions in AFK
- ACBU processing fees displayed in AFK
- Stellar network fees are paid in XLM (stroops), separately from ACBU fees
- Stellar network for blockchain operations
- No USD, USDC, or external currency conversions

### Key Numbers
- 1 AFK = 1 unit of native ACBU
- Stellar network fees: not free; the backend's configured fallback base fee is 100 stroops, while dynamic fees and payment surge buffering can increase the transaction fee
- Soroban transactions can include resource fees; ledger-entry rent or minimum-balance reserves may also apply depending on the operation
- ACBU processing fees: variable by operation and reserve conditions; see the [backend fee policy](https://github.com/Pi-Defi-world/acbu-backend/blob/dev/src/services/feePolicy/feePolicyService.ts)
- Exchange displayed in rates tabs (informational only)

The backend resolves Stellar base and payment fees in its [Stellar fee manager](https://github.com/Pi-Defi-world/acbu-backend/blob/dev/src/services/stellar/feeManager.ts). Network fees are separate from ACBU processing fees; minimum-balance reserves are locked funds, not network fees.
